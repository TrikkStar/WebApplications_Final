# WebApplications_Final

This project is a joint collaberation between Shelby Babcock and myself to build a web based method of compairing sorting algorithms. 

##Description

Our application will give users a visual representation of various sorting algorithms with the ability to compare their efficencies side by side.

Users will be able to select from a variety of pre-made arrays to sort, or supply their own array of intigers for sorting.
