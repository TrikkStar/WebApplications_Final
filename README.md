# WebApplications_Final

This project is a joint collaberation between Shelby Babcock and myself to build a web based method of compairing sorting algorithms. A link to a usable version of the project can be found [here](http://rawgit.com/TrikkStar/WebApplications_Final/master/index.html). 

##Description

Our application will give users a visual representation of various sorting algorithms with the ability to compare their time efficencies side by side.

Users will be able to select from a variety of pre-made algorithms to sort with, the default of having no algorithms selected will run them all.  

Users will be able to supply a custom array od numbers or strings for the selected algorithms to sort. If no text information is given, a random array of the selected type will be generated for the algorithms to use. 

The sorted arrays will be displayed on te bottom of the page, along with the corosponding algorithm that sorted it and how long it took to sort with that algorithm.
